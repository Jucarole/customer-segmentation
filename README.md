# Customer Segmentation
On this project, I work with the dataset "Online Retail" that you can find on the UCI ML Repository.

The objective of this project is to perform a customer classification and analyze the results to translate this into new valuable information for the business. 

To achieve the above, it's necessary to clean and transform the data from item-customer-centric to customer-centric.
The transformation process need a first aproximation to NLP due the column "Description" with vectorization and clustering, then it's turn of customer data goruping, the main job is to do an excelent product description with the data available and finally it's time for the last classification stage to get all the customer clusters.
